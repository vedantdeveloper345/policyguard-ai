# PolicyGuard AI – Automated Compliance Monitoring

## 🚀 Overview
PolicyGuard AI is an AI-powered system that converts unstructured compliance policy documents into executable database rules.

## 🔍 Problem
Compliance policies are stored as text documents, while enterprise data exists in structured databases. Manual auditing is slow and error-prone.

## 💡 Solution
- Extract rules using OpenAI
- Validate structured conditions
- Execute dynamic SQL against enterprise data
- Detect and log violations
- Enable continuous monitoring via scheduler

## 🏗 Tech Stack
- Python (FastAPI)
- PostgreSQL
- OpenAI API
- React + Tailwind
- APScheduler

## 🧪 MVP Scope
- Single policy ingestion
- Expense table compliance enforcement
- 2–3 deterministic rule evaluation
- Violation logging
